			<h1>What is Framing</h1>
			<p>For many of us the scrapbooking process, from concept to completion can be a long, intimidating, expensive process. We’ve been there...staring at our paper, or our photos, hoping that a new and interesting idea will leap out at us. Poring through magazines, or browsing blogs in search of inspiration. And then, when we finally get to work, we find that we are nervous about cutting into our favorite paper, or cropping our photos, because we aren’t sure how it will look in the end. How do I fit a lot of pictures on a page (we never snap just one!) and still end up with a beautiful layout? My pictures cost me a couple of dollars, but my embellishments cost me ten. And when I add those embellishments to my page, how do I make sure that the pictures are still the star?</p>
			<p>Or maybe you are contemplating getting into scrapbooking, but are too overwhelmed or intimidated to take the plunge! Am I really creative enough? Do I have the time or the money to be a Scrapbooker?</p>
			<p>We understand your frustration!</p>
			<p>The process of “Framing” was designed by scrapbookers, for scrapbookers. You will be surprised at how quickly and easily you will create stunning layouts, using this simple technique!</p>
